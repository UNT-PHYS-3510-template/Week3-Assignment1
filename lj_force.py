# Week 2 Assignment 1
# Code to compute the force between two Argon atoms, starting from the Lennard-Jones expression of the potential energy. 
#
# Authors: Oliviero Andreussi, Student
# 
# Variables: 
#   epsilon and sigma: LJ parmeters in atomic units
#   distance: distance between atoms in atomic units
#   flj: magnitude of the force acting on the atoms
#
epsilon = 4.0e-4 # these are a.u.
sigma = 6 # also a.u.
distance = float(input('Specify the distance between the atoms (in a.u.): '))
flj = 
print("The force acting on two Argon atoms at a distance of %f a.u. is equal to %f a.u." %(distance,flj))
